## Season of KDE Selection


Hey people from around the world !!

I am Anubhav Choudhary, an engineering student from India. I recently got selected in [Season of KDE 2021](https://season.kde.org) to work under [Calamares](https://calamares.io) project. My work is to resolve numerous issues and complete some tasks mentioned on [Calamares' Issue page](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/labels/hacktoberfest).  And I am just too excited about that. Why? Because I have been contributing to open source (to KDE? yes) for sometime now. But It always felt very unordered and random contributions (which I was not happy about). But now that I'm in SoK and things are preplanned, hopefully these next 3 months will be smooth and calm.

A big thank to **Carl Schwan** and **Adriaan de Groot**  for help and mentorship.

I would be writing some more blogs as I proceed forward to contribute in Calamares. I would love to hear from you readers (feedback, suggestions, comments anything).

Thanks for reading and long live open source :)
