Most of my work is lying in open source regime, with majority of it in [calamares](https://github.com/calamares/calamares).

But I have a few small personal projects too :

- FakeFeed
- knowFootball API
- Supermarkeet
- Pen
- Blogga
- Automeet

... I am continuously adding more

See some of my code on [Github](https://github.com/deprov447)
