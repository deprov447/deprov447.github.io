Hello people,

I go by the nickname of '**deprov447**'

Properly, I am a web developer. But I try doing everything, ranging from competetive programming to desktop app development, from kernel development to blockchain. (and sometimes ricing). Currently I am working with **KDE**, and trying to contribute my share of code to open source world. 

And apart from these, I love Football, Good Music and Space stuff
