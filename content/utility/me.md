Hello people,

Going by the nickname of '**deprov447**', currently I am pursuing my engineering graduation in computer science and engineering from IIIT-Bh. 

Properly, I am a web developer. But I try doing everything, ranging from competitive programming to desktop app development, from kernel development to blockchain. (and sometimes ricing). Currently I am working with **KDE**, and trying to contribute my share of code to open source world. 

And in my free time, I love watching football, jamming to good music and reading about the universe.
