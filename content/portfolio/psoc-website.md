shortDescription: 
challenge: The programming society of IIIT - Bhubaneswar didn't had a proper website for announcements, and to document whatever was going on in the club. Often there was confusion among attendees regarding the events, because a lot of information was unable to be communicated properly.
solution: We developed a static website, with focus on minimalism and flexibility of adding/updating content. It is a hugo based website, using markdown content management, which will be the new interface of programming society, BBSR to the world.
