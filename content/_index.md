Hello, I am **Anubhav Choudhary**, currently pursuing my engineering graduation in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Bh, India.

Properly, I am a web developer. but I try exploring everything, ranging from competitive programming to desktop app development, from low level development to ricing.

And in my free time, I love watching football, jamming to good music and reading. Força Barça
