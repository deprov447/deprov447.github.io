College is a wonderland for most of the people. It is one interesting place every student in his 17s (new word alert !!) dream about. And same was for me. The hurry of getting into college was one of reason I didn't took a drop after 12th. So here is my experience of college (till date):

### Getting into . . .

Now first of all after JOSAA Councelling, I had to convince my overlords why I wanted to join this college, on the other side of world, when I have these 2 great choices :

- Take a drop and prepare for IITs, again
- Or join some similar colleges nearby

But both weren't fitting my brains jigsaw. So first I rejected because... I've told you already. And second's you'll understand, wait.

So gave a fight, did 1-2 hunger strikes and finally was going (somewhere) ...

### Day 1 . . .

So the day 1 was all you can expect of your new college. Today I met some great floormates (and when I say floormates, that include Â±1 floors too), gone out to play football and guess what, had an interaction with the seniors (iynwim). All and all a good start

### Week 1 . . . 

A confusion period. Where's the class? Who is Sanjeev Kumar Mishra? Why the hell is that guy singing like Madonna? ***Itne keede kyun hen yahan?***
But as the day passed, things went familiar. I remember in the first week only we were out of college, roaming in the city (with absolutely -1 knowledge about that place, and no localite with us (relief?)).

### Month 1 . . .

By these times, we were almost partying always. It was hard to find a floor, not having a music concert going on. Freshers Party, Football , Birthdays, Video games, Movies, Series, Outings and most of all, Monsoon. This was the best period till now in college. We were meeting new people, tasting some different (!good) cuisine and wearing casuals to college (one big perk). 

### Year 1 . . .

Now finally our first year of graduation. It was seeming like we have made all the memories there can be. We played, studied, (had crushes). The Diwali, The Holi, Advaita, Mass Bunks..... just mesmerizing. Don't think I can pen down everything 

### Nowadays

Nowadays? Nowadays life is hell :/ Just eating, sleeping and always being on Laptop. When will these guys open the college !?!
