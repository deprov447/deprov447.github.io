This isn't something you would wanna read if you're in a good mood. This is something thats gonna put you to feel really insecured and helpless about the "ways of world"


> This isn’t to offend you or discourage you from doing what you’re doing… It’s more of a “Take what you get” kinda text…

  

So my mom was talking about something. I don’t clearly remember what got her started but the thing to zero in was this:

  

She had this long distant relative (mausi/aunty i guess) who had barely passed class 8th and had no further formal education. The people there believed  *ki ladki padhaoge to mar jaegi* (Teaching a girl would kill her) !!!

  

And this girl had a thing for studying, but it’s insane for an Indian girl to do something that isn’t approved by her family. So clearly she can’t study anymore, at least of that her family can know. So she adopted a technique. She used to scribble math on the ground **while having a dump**. Yes… 

  

How could someone imagine this is India a mere 50 years back? Not kidding, this person is still alive. The 2 sides of war here, if you’d say, were a society that is scared to death towards girl education, and a girl committed towards educating herself.

  

I wouldn’t say anything more… Just ponder this situation and proceed accordingly.
