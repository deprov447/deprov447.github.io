      <description>Front Space: Create your portfolio in seconds Front Space is a platform to quickly create single-page websites and host them on a custom subdomain for the world to see.Â A Quick Back Story I am always fascinated with beautiful web designs and portfolios. I randomly scroll through Product Hunt and r/web_design. And this app is basically a result of that only. For a long time, I had been thinking of making such an app, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the motivation.</description>

      <description>Season of KDE 2021 Final Update Hello again everyone, I wrote my last update related to Season of KDE in January, and now is the time for the final update. I am sorry I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write blogs in between. The 3 months passed by like at supersonic speed.
So I was selected to work on Calamares project under Adriaan de Groot. Most of my work revolved around the functionality of sending the installation logs to paste server online.</description>

My work is to resolve numerous issues and complete some tasks mentioned on Calamares&amp;rsquo; Issue page. And I am just too excited about that. Why? Because I have been contributing to open source (to KDE? yes) for sometime now.</description>
