I am sorry I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write blogs in between. The 3 months passed by like at supersonic speed.
So I was selected to work on Calamares project under Adriaan de Groot. Most of my work revolved around the functionality of sending the installation logs to paste server online.</description></item><item><title>Season of KDE Selection</title><link>https://deprov447.github.io/posts/sok-selection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 12:40:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://deprov447.github.io/posts/sok-selection/</guid><description>Season of KDE Selection Hey people from around the world !!
I am Anubhav Choudhary, an engineering student from India. I recently got selected in Season of KDE 2021 to work under Calamares project. My work is to resolve numerous issues and complete some tasks mentioned on Calamares&amp;rsquo; Issue page. And I am just too excited about that. Why? Because I have been contributing to open source (to KDE? yes) for sometime now.</description></item></channel></rss>
