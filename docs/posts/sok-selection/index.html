			<p>Hey people from around the world !!</p>
<p>I am Anubhav Choudhary, an engineering student from India. I recently got selected in <a href="https://season.kde.org">Season of KDE 2021</a> to work under <a href="https://calamares.io">Calamares</a> project. My work is to resolve numerous issues and complete some tasks mentioned on <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/labels/hacktoberfest">Calamares&rsquo; Issue page</a>.  And I am just too excited about that. Why? Because I have been contributing to open source (to KDE? yes) for sometime now. But It always felt very unordered and random contributions (which I was not happy about). But now that I&rsquo;m in SoK and things are preplanned, hopefully these next 3 months will be smooth and calm.</p>
<p>A big thank to <strong>Carl Schwan</strong> and <strong>Adriaan de Groot</strong>  for help and mentorship.</p>
<p>I would be writing some more blogs as I proceed forward to contribute in Calamares. I would love to hear from you readers (feedback, suggestions, comments anything).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and long live open source :)</p>
