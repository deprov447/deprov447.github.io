      <description>what is a terminal emulator? the thing that appears when you press ctrl shift t on a linux system, maybe xterm, maybe konsole, maybe st etc. so basically in the olden days there were these gigantic machines, (computer), and talking to it requires you to enter commands on teletype (this is from where term tty come, more later) and the output gets printed on a sheet of paper. watch this amazing video for an idea, at least the last part.</description>

      <description>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. &amp;mdash; Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&#xA;Code comments are one of the things which are as conflicted as one&amp;rsquo;s belief of best programming language. Some believe in no comment at all, some in extensive commenting, some in &amp;ldquo;block commenting&amp;rdquo;, and others in &amp;ldquo;line commenting&amp;rdquo;. What is right really depends on the situation and the needs.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, I recently completed my LFX Mentorship project. I was a mentee for the LFXM summer term of 2022 at Pixie, a CNCF sandbox project donated by The New Relic.&#xA;In this blog, I will be sharing my experience of mentorship. (TLDR; just awesome, one-of-a-kind experience &amp;lt;3)&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re also applying for this (which every open-source newbie should), or have a doubt, feel free to drop me a message. I&amp;rsquo;d be more than happy to help.</description>

      <description>Hello again everyone, I wrote my last update related to Season of KDE in January, and now is the time for the final update. I am sorry I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write blogs in between. The 3 months passed by like at supersonic speed.&#xA;So I was selected to work on Calamares project under Adriaan de Groot. Most of my work revolved around the functionality of sending the installation logs to paste server online.</description>

      <title>Kernel Based Virtualization</title>

      <description>KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is an open source, full virtualization solution for x86 hardwares containing virtualization extensions. It is a hypervisor built into the Linux kernel and unlike regular VM players like Virtualbox and VMware which use emulation, KVM uses CPU extensions for hardware assisted virtualization via a kernel module (thats the secret for that blazing speed). Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter and all the peripherals.</description>

      <description>Hey people from around the world !!&#xA;I am Anubhav Choudhary, an engineering student from India. I recently got selected in Season of KDE 2021 to work under Calamares project. My work is to resolve numerous issues and complete some tasks mentioned on Calamares&amp;rsquo; Issue page. And I am just too excited about that. Why? Because I have been contributing to open source (to KDE? yes) for sometime now. But It always felt very unordered and random contributions (which I was not happy about).</description>

Then booted the laptop using that.</description>
