## Installation

This is a simplified set of instructions and assumes a basic understanding of building Hugo sites and installing themes. For detailed instructions, refer to the full [theme documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/).

There are a few ways to install the Congo theme into your Hugo website.

### Install using Hugo

This method is the quickest and easiest for keeping the theme up-to-date. Hugo Modules uses Go to initialise and manage modules so you need to ensure you have Go installed before proceeding.

1. [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install Go. You can check if it's already installed by using the command `go version`.
2. From your Hugo project's directory, initiate the Hugo Modules system for your website:

   ```shell
   hugo mod init github.com/<username>/<repo-name>
   ```

3. Add the theme to your configuration by creating a new file `config/_default/module.toml` and adding the following:

   ```toml
   [[imports]]
   path = "github.com/jpanther/congo"
   ```

4. Start your server using `hugo server` and the theme will be downloaded automatically.
5. Continue to [set up the theme configuration files](#set-up-theme-configuration-files).

### Install using git

Change into the directory for your Hugo website, initialise a new repository and add Congo as a submodule.

```bash
cd mywebsite
git init
git submodule add -b stable https://github.com/jpanther/congo.git themes/congo
```

Then continue to [set up the theme configuration files](#set-up-theme-configuration-files).

### Install manually

Download the latest release of the theme from: [https://github.com/jpanther/congo/releases/latest](https://github.com/jpanther/congo/releases/latest)

Extract the archive, rename the folder to `congo` and move it to the `themes/` directory inside your Hugo project.

Then continue to [set up the theme configuration files](#set-up-theme-configuration-files).

### Set up theme configuration files

In the root folder of your website, delete the `config.toml` file that was generated by Hugo. Copy the `*.toml` config files from the theme into your `config/_default/` folder. If you installed using Hugo Modules, you should not copy the `module.toml` file! This will ensure you have all the correct theme settings and will enable you to easily customise the theme.

Depending on how you installed the theme you will find the theme config files in different places:

- **Hugo Modules:** In the Hugo cache directory, or [download a copy](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/jpanther/congo/tree/stable/config/_default) from GitHub
- **Git submodule or Manual install:** `themes/congo/config/_default`

> **Important:** If you didn't use Hugo Modules to install Congo, you must add the line `theme = "congo"` to the top of your `config.toml` file.

You're now all set up to use Congo. From here you can add some content and start the Hugo server.

## Configuration

For all the theme options and detailed configuration instructions, refer to the [Congo docs](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/).

A few things you need to set for a new installation:

```toml
# config/_default/config.toml

baseURL = "https://your_domain.com"
languageCode = "en-AU"
title = "My awesome website"

[author]
name = "Your name"
links = [
  { twitter = "https://twitter.com/jpanther" }
]
```

## Advanced customisation

Refer to the [theme documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/advanced-customisation/) for details on customising Congo, including rebuilding the theme from scratch.
