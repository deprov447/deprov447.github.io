I randomly scroll through Product Hunt and r/web_design. And this app is basically a result of that only.

Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter and all the peripherals.</description></item><item><title>Season of KDE Selection</title><link>https://deprov447.github.io/posts/sok-selection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 12:40:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://deprov447.github.io/posts/sok-selection/</guid><description>Season of KDE Selection Hey people from around the world !!
